## Purpose

Although religions are inherently evil and stupid after they go extinct (which will hopefully happen soon) there should be some alternative philosophical and ethical approaches to live. Nūtana Dhārma is one such an approach. Nūtana Dhārma is scientifically, logically and ethically better than all religions combined.

Nūtana Dhārma is not a religion. You can consider it as a **SciLoSophy** (**sci**ence+**lo**gic+philo**sophy**). Religions not just try to answer moral questions, they also try to answer scientific questions. But the answers to scientific questions given in religion are dogmatic in nature. Scilosophies don't go against logic and scientific consensus but different scilosophies might have different ethical approaches.

Nūtana Dhārma is a non-profit and non-prophet SciLoSophy. Anyone can [contribute](/contribute) to Nūtana Dhārma and the maintainer of the SciLoSophy will scrutinize them logically and approve the changes if they are good.
