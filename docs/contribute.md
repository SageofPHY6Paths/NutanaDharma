## Guidelines for editing

* At the end of each page there is a  link that says **Edit this page on GitHub**. By clicking that you will reach the GitHub page where you can edit it.
* Pages are written in Markdown. You should edit your fork and send us a pull request.
* The maintainer will allow your edits if we think they are in line with the goal of this site.
* Do not copy paste entire Wikipedia in the Knowledge section. The Knowledge section is the **minimal** amount of knowledge everyone should know.
* Any chapter in the Knowledge section should not exceed 50 pages.

## Donate

We do not need any donation. Please donate to poor people who are facing problems instead of us. For Indians there are several options in the PhonePe app. **We advise you to donate 5% of your income to charities that help either poor people or unfortunate animals and we also suggest everyone to become vegan, considering that being vegan is a moral obligation**. Of course, donating to religious institutes is immoral so don't do that.
